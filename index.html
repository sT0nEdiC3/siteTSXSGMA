                            <p>Spontaneous bodily sensations - The "body high" of our product can be described as a pleasurable all-encompassing glow. It maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can remain for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended.</p>
                            <p>Physical euphoria - It should be noted that this effect is not as reliably produced as it is with substances like stimulants or entactogens, and can just as easily manifest as physical discomfort for no apparent reason.</p>
                            <p>Changes in felt gravity - At higher doses, physical feelings of being launched across vast distances at incredibly high speeds are commonly reported.</p>
                            <p>Spatial disorientation</p>
                            <p>Changes in felt bodily form</p>
                            <p>Physical autonomy</p>
                            <p>Nausea - This effect is much less common. However, it can still manifest spontaneously and sometimes lead to sudden bouts of vomiting.</p>
                            <p>Pupil dilation</p>
                            <p>Increased heart rate</p>

</p>
                            <p>Drifting (melting, breathing, morphing and flowing) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.

                            <p>Geometry - The visual geometry encountered can be described as more similar in appearance to that of other products. It can be comprehensively described through its variations as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, equally organic and digital in feel, structured in organization, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in sharp and soft edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in depth and consistent in its intensity. At higher doses, it is significantly more likely to result in states of level 8B visual geometry over level 8A.
</p>
                            <p>The geometry present with smokeable product is considered by many to be the most profoundly intricate and complex set of visual geometry found within the entirety of the experience. In comparison to orally active product, it is significantly more digital in appearance and contains a colour scheme which is a structured style.</p>
                            <p>Hallucinatory states&nbsp; - Our product produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used psychedelic. These effects include:
</p>
                            <p>Machinescapes
</p>
                            <p>Transformations
</p>
                            <p>Internal hallucination (autonomous entities; settings, sceneries, and landscapes; perspective hallucinations and scenarios and plots) - Our product produces high level internal hallucinations at appropriate doses more consistently than that of any other psychedelic. They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their variations as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.

                            <p>Increased music appreciation - This typically occurs only at lower sub-breakthrough doses, and is not as prominent of an effect as it is with longer lasting products. Many people prefer to have their experiences in complete silence, other than shutting out perceptual distractions this is often done to prevent a muddled or overwhelming experience.
</p>
                            <p>Mindfulness - This effect tends to occur after the experience has ended and the individual has returned to ordinary waking consciousness, to a sense of presence and sensitivity towards one's inner sensations as well as outer environment.
</p>
                            <p>Multiple thought streams - This effect tends to manifest in a much more chaotic fashion, in tandem with the sensation of cognitive overload.

Time distortion - This effect is a very prominent aspect of the experience, which only tends to last under 15 minutes but is commonly reported to subjectively feel as if it had lasted much longer, in some cases "many lifetimes" or even an "eternity". This particular effect is most prevalent and notable with "breakthrough" experiences.</p>

                            <p>For a number of individuals these effects are consistently more reproducible and powerful with smoked or vaporized product than they are with "classical products", this is most likely due to its very intense but relatively short-lived effects.

                            <p><i><b>Warning:</b> Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous or even <b>life-threatening</b> when combined with certain other substances. The following lists some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them). Please use caution when mixing our product with other substances.</i></p>
                            <p>Lithium - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of bipolar disorder. There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with psychedelics significantly increases the risk of psychosis and seizures. As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
</p>
                            <p>Cannabis - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of our product. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks, and psychosis. Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
</p>
                            <p>Stimulants - Stimulants like amphetamine, cocaine or methylphenidate affect many parts of the brain and alter dopaminergic function. This combination can increase the risk of anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks, and thought loops. This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of mania and psychosis.
</p>
                            <p>
Tramadol - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and psychedelics may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.</p>
